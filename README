# To run code:
# (1) big3/lib includes all personal libraries and will need to be bundled or added to python path
# (2) for some of the code, you will need a similar data and modeling directory structure
#     to automatically load data and save model outputs

# Dependencies:
# (1) Python (numpy, scipy, shapely, paraview, matplotlib, many others)
# (2) Elmersolver parallel version (with mumps, hypre)
# (3) gmsh
# (4) paraview with python support
