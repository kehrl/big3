(1) FIX/CHECK SIA - maybe not doing it the best way right now - 
should I be pulling thickness and height from mesh rather than from original data?
(it doesn't really matter, but first approach might be more sound)

(2) Weertman
-probably can't invert for this coefficient directly, but should be able to compute from beta squared
-however, this is giving weird results
-might be because we are looking at a steady state simulation? maybe we need to do a transient simulation with free surfaces

-NEXT STEP: try it with high res

(3) Free surface

(4) Flowing too fast at calving face


model1.sif
-STEADY STATE
-no free surfaces
-water pressure at calving front
-linear sliding law

model2.sif
-model1.sif
-changes sliding law to Weertman's sliding law

model3.sif
-model2.sif
-TRANSIENT
-adds free surface to surface

model4.sif
-model3.sif
-adds free surface to bottom

model5.sif
-model4.sif
-adds buoyancy solver
